# Weather Dashboard  
What follow is the week six homework for the University of Richmond's Coding Boot Camp.  
The Weather Dashboard is the one-stop web application, where you can plan your  
days, trips, and vacations accordingly, by checking the forecasted weather in any city in the US.  

### Uses and How to Use  

When you first navigate to the site, your eyes are drawn to the current weather that is displayed, as shown below.  
You can use the search bar, at the top of the page, to search for a city to display its weather and forecast.  



After searching for a city, that city is saved in the user's local storage, and is then displayed in a card, as shown below.  
You can click on a city on the card, to also display that city's weather and forecast.
